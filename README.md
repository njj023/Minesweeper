Minesweeper
===========

JS based Minesweeper written in AngularJS. You can play based off of difficulty levels or with your custom set grid.

While this is completely JS based, it is recommended to run it on some simple web server ("python -m SimpleHTTPServer") to avoid browser security issues with Angular.
